# FPP Setup Notes (Pi)

- Network: static IP for show network; keep Wi‑Fi for admin if needed.
- Outputs: E1.31/DMX for Falcon F16v5; configure universes to match xLights.
- Playlists: upload FSEQ via xLights "Upload to FPP".
- Triggers: serial/MQTT/GPIO as required (Arduino → Pi later).

Back up: **FPP Settings → Backup/Restore → Create Backup** and save into `fpp/`.
